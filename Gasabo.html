        <h1>About Gasabo</h1>
        <p>
            Gasabo is one of the districts of Kigali City, the capital of Rwanda. 
            Located in the northern and eastern parts of Kigali, it is the largest 
            district in both area and population. Gasabo is a key administrative and 
            economic zone, hosting major government institutions, businesses, and residential 
            neighborhoods. The district blends urban and rural features, with areas like Kimironko, 
            Remera, and Kinyinya being highly developed, while other sectors maintain a more 
            traditional lifestyle. Rich in historical significance, Gasabo is believed to be 
            the cradle of the Rwandan kingdom. It plays a vital role in the 
            country’s development and modernization efforts.
